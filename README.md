# Bike Store Analysis

## Personal Project Overview

This personal project involves the analysis of a bike store dataset using Microsoft's DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) language and Power BI visualization tool. The project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the business performance of the bike store, facilitating informed decision-making and performance monitoring.

## Project Components

### Data Analysis
- Leveraged DAX for comprehensive data analysis of the AdventureWorks dataset.
- Conducted in-depth analysis of sales, inventory, and customer data to identify trends and patterns.

### Data Preprocessing
- Integrated data cleansing and preprocessing procedures to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset to improve the quality of analysis.

### Dashboard Development
- Developed an interactive graphical interface using Power BI to showcase key performance indicators (KPIs) and facilitate data exploration.
- Implemented dynamic features such as slicers, filters, and drill-down functionalities for deeper insights into the data.

### Reporting
- Reported insights derived from the analysis for informed decision-making by stakeholders.
- Provided recommendations for improving business performance and optimizing operations based on the analysis findings.

## Usage
